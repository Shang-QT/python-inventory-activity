**Python Inventory System**

**Problem Description**

The goal of this activity is to create a simple inventory management program using Python. The program will store item names in a list and their corresponding prices in a dictionary. Users should be able to add new items to the inventory by entering an item name and its price. If the item already exists, the program must prevent duplicates.
The program should also allow users to update the price of an existing item. When the user enters the name of an item, the program will check if it exists in the inventory. If it does, the price will be updated; if not, an error message will be displayed.
